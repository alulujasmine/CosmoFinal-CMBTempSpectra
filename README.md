# AY15206CosmoFinal
This repository includes two files.
1. CMB-Temp-Power-Spectra-varying-w-latest.ipynb
This program is invented to do the calculation in the final project of the class AY15206 cosmology at University of Science and Technology of China.
It is used to compute the CMB temperature power spectrum with varing dark energy of state based on CAMB.
It should be run in jupyter notebook, jupyter lab or any other text editor with a jupyter and python compiler.

2. JiaLu-CMB_Temp_Spectra_with_varying_w.pdf
This file is the final report of the CMB temperature power spectra as the final project of the class AY15206 cosmology at University of Science and Technology of China.
